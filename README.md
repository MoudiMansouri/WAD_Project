# WAD_Project
Web Application Development Project

A web application that lets you guess the lyrics to strange popular music. 

Multiple artists will be presented in which the user can select one of them and go through a 10-20 music snippets and try to guess what is being said. 
A user can register, sign in and select the artists he wants to guess. This is required for users who wish to track their scores and view their profile for their high scores on each test. A user that does not wish to register can play the game at the cost of not having his score registered.
When an aritst is selected, they will be shown a screen with the wave form of the snippet that cannot be paused or rewinded so that they have to guess it from the first try. Four lyric options will be shown with absurd variations of what could be said. When the user selects one of them, they will be notfied to whether or not their answer was correct. The score is added up at the end and then registered in the database.
